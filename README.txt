These are my drush makefiles used to simplify installation of new drupal sites using drush
and drush make.

The Master Branch contains a quick and easy Drupal 7 makefile that download drupal 7 core along
with views and the views dependency chaos tools. It also adds the Omega theme, the Omega Tools module
to quickly make an Omega Base Theme using drush, and  the Sky theme

The commerce branch inlcudes the standard Drupal 7 along with the Drupal Commerce contributed module and
the various dependencies needed for it.
